## Psychological Design Principles

- Aesthetic-Usability Effect:

  The perception that aesthetically pleasing design is more usable

- Doherty Threshold:

  Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace that neither has to wait on the other (<400ms latency)

- Fitts' Law:

  The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target

- Hick's Law:

  The time it takes to make a decision is a function of the number and complexity of options available

- Jakob's law:

  Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way

- Law of Common Region:

  Elements tend to be perceived in groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary

- Law of Prägnanz:

  People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible,
  because it is the interpretation that requires the leas cognitive effort

- Law of Proximity:

  People perceive and interpret objects that are close to each other as the same object/group

- Law of Similarity:

  People perceive and interpret objects that are similar in form and function as the same object/group

- Law of Uniform Connectedness

  People perceive and interpret objects that are connected in a uniform way as the same object/group

- Miller's Law:
- Occam's Razor:
- Pareto Principle:
- Parkinson's Law:
- Postel's Law:
- Serial Position Effect:
- Tesler's Law:
- Von Restorff's Effect:
- Zeigarnik Effect:

## Gestalt Principles:

- Figure-ground: Tendency to look for a for- and background
- Similarity: Tendency to group things that are similar (color, shape, size, etc.)
- Proximity: Tendency to group/relate things that are close together
- Common Region: Tendency to group/relate things located withing the same closed region
- Continuity: Tendency to group/relate things that are connected by a continuous path (line, curve, etc)
- Closure: Tendency to look for a single, recognizable pattern when confronted with complex arrangements,
  even filling in missing parts if needed (e.g. a stripes only zebra, or spots only giraffe or dalmatian, etc.)
- Focal Point: Tendency for whatever stands out visually to capture and hold the viewer’s attention first
