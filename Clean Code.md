# Clean Code

## Meaningful Names

*Good*:
- Intentionally revealing
- Meaningful and distinct
- Pronounceable
- Searchable
- Consistent
- Understandable: Computer Science / Domain
- In a meaningful context

*Bad*:
- Disinformation or false clues
- Encoding
- Need for mental mapping
- Being cute
- Puns
- Gratuitous context

**Classes**: nouns or noun phrase  
**Methods**: verbs or verb phrase

## Functions

They should:
- Be small
- Have minimal nesting
- Do one thing / List things at just one level of abstraction
    - Change state of object
    - Return information on an object
- Have structure if they are larger than desired
	- Sections: declarations / initializations / sieve

**Switch Statements** should:
- Appear only once (in an abstract factory)
- Create polymorphic objects
- Be hidden behind an inheritance relationship

**Arguments**:
- Minimal number of arguments (Never more than three)
- They need a good reason to exist
	- A question about the argument
	- Operations on an argument (Move function to argument object?)
	- An event as argument
- Avoid output arguments (Outputs should be in return statement)
    - House the function in the object with the state change
- Avoid flags (booleans)
- Avoid side effects

**Exceptions over Error Codes**

*Error codes*:
- Lead to deeply nested structures
- Caller has to deal with it immediately
- Need for rebuilding when adding new error code

*Exceptions*:
- Separate happy path from error processing
- No need to rebuild: all derivative of exception.class

**Try/Catch** blocks
- Extract the bodies into functions

## DRY

*Don't Repeat Yourself.*

A lot of evolution in languages and frameworks aims avoid repeating code:
- Codd's forms
- OOP
- Aspect oriented programming
- Component oriented programming
- ...

**Structural Programming Rules**:
What Dijkstra said about code block or function:
- One entry
- One exit
- No:
    - break
    - continue
    - goto !!!

**Now**:
These rules are less important now we are able to use smaller functions.
Breaks and continues can help in our expressions.

**Method**:
We start by writing a first draft and then improve our code to apply these good practices.

## Comments

*At best, comments are a necessary evil.*

**GOOD Comments**:
- Legal comments (copyright, ...)
- Informative (Example format, return type ... What?)
- Explanation of intent (Why?)
- Clarification (Readability)
- Warnings of consequence
- TODO
- Amplify (Draw attention)
- Javadocs for public API

**BAD Comments**:
- Mumbling
- Redundant
- Mandated
- Journal
- Noise
- Scary noise
- Position markers
- Closing braces
- Attributions and bylines
- Commented out code
- HTML comments
- Non-logical info
- Too much info
- Inobvious connection
- Function headers
- ...

## Formatting

Formatting tools:  
Consistently apply rules to help communicate the code

*While functionality changes, readability usually continues to affect the maintainability.*

- **Vertical**
    - File / Class size
        - Smaller = More easy to read
    - Blank lines are viual cues
    - Vertical density should indicate relations
    
Locations
- Local variables at the top of functions
- Control values for loops in loop statements
- Instance variables at top of class
- Dependant functions should be vertically close
    - Caller should be above the callee
- Functions with conceptual affinity should be vertically close

- **Horizontal**
    - Keep lines short
    - Closely related values should be horizontally close (like parameters in a function)
    - A space can indicate 'less relation' compared to no space (like with an assignment)
    - We can make precedence of operations more visual with spaces (doesn't work with formatting tool)

*When you feel like a long list of declarations needs spacing in Java, you should probably split the class.*

**Indentation**:  
Visualises the scope hierarchy.
- Avoid breaking the rule on indentation even in compact structures
- Mind dummy scopes (the semicolon after a one liner is easy to miss)

***Teams should agree on a single style of formatting. Consistent gestures help readability a lot.***

## Objects & Datastructutres

Hiding implementation â‰  Layer of functions between the variables.

**Objects**

- Abstractions
- Exposing functions
    - Manipulating the essence of the object
    - Not knowing the implementation

**Data structures**
- Exposing data
- No meaningful functions

**Procedural vs Visitor- or Dual-Dispatch Pattern**
Sometimes you really do want simple data structures with procedures operating on them.
(It is just a myth that "everything is an object".)

### The Law of Demeter

*(Modules shouldn't know about innards of the objects it manipulates.)*

A method **f** of a class **C** should only call methods of these:
- C
- An object created by f
- An object held in an instance variable of C

The method should NOT invoke methods on objects that are returned by any of the allowed functions.
("Talk to friends, not to strangers.")

**Chained calls are generally sloppy programming and often rightfully called train wrecks.**

These are in violation of Demeter only if the methods call for objects, but not when just accessing data structures. The difference often gets obscured by accessor functions.

If they are objects we should ask ourselves what we need them for. We should make the initial object 'DO' something for us.
This way we avoid having to know about the inners of the objects.

### Data Transfer Objects

Uses:
- Communication with databases
- Parsing from sockets
- ...

**Beans** are almost equivalent to this, but with accessor functions are 'quasi-encapsulated' without any real benefit.

**Active records** are a special form of DTO, with navigational methods like *save* and *find*.

None of these data structures should contain any business logic, which belongs in separate objects.

## Error Handling

Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it's wrong.

It is cleaner to throw an exception in the callee than it is to use return codes in the caller.

Starting with a Try-Catch-Finally statement will help us define a scope to which we can safely add logic using TDD.

Checked exceptions violate the Open-Closed principle. A change in low level code can force many higher classes add exceptions to method signatures.
This is why other languages don't have any, and we should use unchecked exceptions. They are only useful in critical libraries, not when writing applications.

An exception should provide adequate context in a good error message to locate the error.

### Defining Exceptions

Classifications:
- Source
- Type

How to catch them:
- We should think about a 'common exception type' when we need to catch multiple exceptions.
- Often a wrapper can help us catch and translate exceptions (of a 3d party API).
  - Minimize dependencies
  - Easy to swap out libraries later
  - Easy to mock out 3d party calls in testing
  - Not tied to 3d party API design

One exception class is sufficient for an area of code, unless we want to catch one exception and allow another to pass through.

### Defining Normal Flow

Even better than handling an exception is making it part of the normal flow, by using something like the *Special Case Pattern*.
The client code doesn't need to handle the exception if it is encapsulated in a special case object.

### Don't Return Null
