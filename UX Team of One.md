### Getting Started

Steps:
- Get to know the UX toolkit
- Establish a point of view of what can be improved
- Get to know your users
- Start designing

Activities in UX process:
- Discovery
  - Stakeholder interviews
  - SWOT analysis
  - Requirements gathering
- Strategy
  - Design principles
  - Vision artifacts
  - Roadmaps
- User research
  - Primary user research
  - Secondary user research
  - Personas, mental models, and user stories
- Design
  - Information architecture / Site Map
  - Process and Task Diagrams
  - Wireframes
  - Design Comps
  - Detailed Specifications
  - Style and Pattern Guides
  - Prototypes
- Implementation
  - Usability testing
  - Implementation oversight
  - Metrics / analytics tracking

#### 1. Establish a view on the work to be done:
- Find parts of the product that everyone agrees need improvement
- Write a UX Project Plan, working your way back from questions that need to be answered

Method cards:  
These help identify activities that can provide user-oriented perspective

- [IDEO Method Cards](https://www.ideo.com/post/method-cards)
- [SAP Method Card](https://www.sap.com/dam/application-assets/sap-logo/sap-logo-method-card.pdf)
- [18F Method Card](https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-Print-at-Home.pdf)

Objections:  
*We can avoid objections by not asking for permission, but rather provide 2 options.*

#### 2. Get to know your users:
- Figure out what you know (and don't know)
- Do guerrilla Research

[Article on optimal amount of user exposure](https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/):
- Two hours
- A minimum of every 6 weeks
- In person and remote
- Including non-design personnel (aka everyone)

#### 3. Start designing:
- Sketch your ideas on paper or whiteboard
- Enlist colleagues to generate design ideas
- Learn from other successful products

An inspiration library:  
*A folder where you keep screenshots of notable designs, either for being good, or bad.*


### Building Support for Your Work

- Relationships over process
- Principles/vision about what to make
- Principles/vision about how to work
- Mindset over methods

#### 1. Invite people in
- Be open and accessible
- Be friendly
- Empower others to feel ownership

#### 2. Make things together
- Avoid endless discussions
- Make small examples
- Promote sketching/whiteboarding

#### 3. Truly listen
- Be a facilitator/conduit of ideas
- Cleverly reconcile tensions
- Be truly interested and question what is unclear

#### 4. Know when it is good enough
- The work is never really done
- Learn to see what is 'good enough' to start working

#### Dealing with people issues
- Stay impartial
- Assume good intentions
- Try other perspectives

Techniques:
- Interview the team about how they want t engage with UX
- Build an informal UX network
- Ask others to participate
- Arrange pre-meetings to avoid the 'big reveal'
- Use relatable language

#### Dealing with organizational issues
- Gain access and visibility across departments
- Make the most of insufficient resources

Ideas:
- Offer to visualize requirements
- Help others see how UX impacts the process
- Play nicely with vendors (analytics, development, UX, ...)
  - Get invited to meetings
  - Learn from them
  - Work with them
  - Stay actively involved with execution
- Turn the rubber stamp into an opportunity
- Develop case studies
- Break bread

#### Common objections
- "It's just web design."  
Limiting the scope/responsibility to web or interface limits potential impact

- "We already do market research."  
Market research is about what users want, not how to best achieve it.

- "User experience work is too expensive."  
It's always less expensive to plan before something is built.

- "It takes too much time."  
Realistically it does take some time, but not months. The time spent will defray costs down the road.

- "UX research isn't statistically significant."  
A small sample size can still give the gist of the big trends,
large sample sizes would just be more costly in time and investment.
The idea is not to get market averages, but to get inspiration.
(Just 5 users can help uncover 85% of the usability issues.)

- "We already know what needs to be done."  
UX doesn't only tell you what's wrong, but also why and how to fix it. Or it can help validate a solution.
Watching people use the product can also provide unexpected insights. 

- "That's marketing's/engineering's/product management's job."  
They all have an alternative angle, UX is the glue that binds these considerations together
