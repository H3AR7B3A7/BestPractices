# Clean Architecture

## What is Design & Architecture

**Architecture == Design**

_The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required
system._

When architecture is disregarded, producing features becomes harder, development costs increase and productivity grinds to a halt.

_Sow and steady wins the race._

## A Tale of Two Values

**Value = Behavior x Structure**

To management the behavior seems most important, but the greater value is structure when examining the extremes.

_There are two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent._

Developers and even more so architects as part of the stakeholders need to fight / struggle for clean architecture.

## Programming Paradigms

- 1938: Alan Turing is writing loops, branches, assignments, subroutines, stacks, ... in binary.
- 1940: Assembler languages, to translate into binary.
- 1951: Grace Hopper invented A0, the first compiler.
- 1953: Fortran
- COBOL, PL/1, SNOBOL, C, Pascal, C++, Java, ...
- 3 Paradigms, telling which 'programming structures' to use:
  - Structured
  - Object-oriented
  - Functional
