# Agile Project Management

Project management has only been around since half the twentieth century. 
Winston Royce wrote "Managing the development of Large Software Systems" in the 1970s,
which described the phases in the 'waterfall methodology' as it was coined later.

This methodology was the most common project management approach until it was surpassed
by improved approaches based on agile techniques around 2008.

Traditional projects (if successful at all) often suffer from scope bloat.
Studies show that 64% of requested features are rarely or never used.

Agile techniques are simply a codification of common sense of which seeds date back to
Walter Sherwart's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).
In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka published an article "New Product Development Game"
describing aa rapid, flexible development strategy to meet fast-paced product demand.
This article first paired the word 'Scrum' with product development, which became one of the most
popular agile project management frameworks.

In 2001 the **'Agile Manifesto'** was created, a statement of values for successful software development.

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

*While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

Empirical control requirements:
- Unfettered transparency
- Frequent inspections
- Immediate adaptations

*Working in **sprints** (smaller segments of the overall project) allows for this frequent inspection and adaptation.*

**Strengths of Agile Project Management**:
- Project success rate
- Scope creep
- Immediate adaptation based on frequent inspection
    - Progress
    - Customer satisfaction

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The unique contributions of many individuals can be very powerful.
Where a simple conversation can be clear and efficient, a lot of effort is needed to make
processes and managed/controlled communication unambiguous.
One process doesn't fit all teams and limits involvement of individuals.
Working without individual interactions is overall less Agile.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Supporting development:
- Requirements
- Product technical specifications

*This documentation should cover only 'just enough' information to be practical and efficient.*

Supporting management:
- Project schedule
- Weekly status reports
- Project communication plan

*While helping management, these do not add value to development.*

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

There should be an ongoing good and clear communication with the customer.

Traditionally:
- Start of project
- When scope changes
- End of project

Communication purely for negotiation discourages potentially valuable input from the customer.

You can't know less about a project than at the start,
so locking down project details at this point is hard due to a lack of information.

### Responding to change over following a plan

Frequently adapting to changing expectations will keep the project relevant and also avoids high costs
from making changes in a later stage of product maturity.


## Agile Principles

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantages.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them an environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of success.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances Agility.
- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the work not done - is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
