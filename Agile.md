# Agile Project Management

Project management has only been around since half the twentieth century. 
Winston Royce wrote "Managing the development of Large Software Systems" in the 1970s,
which described the phases in the 'waterfall methodology' as it was coined later.

This methodology was the most common project management approach until it was surpassed
by improved approaches based on agile techniques around 2008.

Traditional projects (if successful at all) often suffer from scope bloat.
Studies show that 64% of requested features are rarely or never used.

Agile techniques are simply a codification of common sense of which seeds date back to
Walter Sherwart's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).
In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka published an article "New Product Development Game"
describing aa rapid, flexible development strategy to meet fast-paced product demand.
This article first paired the word 'Scrum' with product development, which became one of the most
popular agile project management frameworks.

In 2001 the 'Agile Manifesto' was created, a statement of values for successful software development.

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

*While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

Empirical control requirements:
- Unfettered transparency
- Frequent inspections
- Immediate adaptations

*Working in **sprints** (smaller segments of the overall project) allows for this frequent inspection and adaptation.*

**Strengths of Agile Project Management**:
- Project success rate
- Scope creep
- Immediate adaptation based on frequent inspection
    - Progress
    - Customer satisfaction
