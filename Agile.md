# Agile Project Management

Project management has only been around since half the twentieth century. 
Winston Royce wrote "Managing the development of Large Software Systems" in the 1970s,
which described the phases in the 'waterfall methodology' as it was coined later.

This methodology was the most common project management approach until it was surpassed
by improved approaches based on agile techniques around 2008.

Traditional projects (if successful at all) often suffer from scope bloat.
Studies show that 64% of requested features are rarely or never used.

Agile techniques are simply a codification of common sense of which seeds date back to
Walter Sherwart's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).
In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka published an article "New Product Development Game"
describing aa rapid, flexible development strategy to meet fast-paced product demand.
This article first paired the word 'Scrum' with product development, which became one of the most
popular agile project management frameworks.

In 2001 the **'Agile Manifesto'** was created, a statement of values for successful software development.

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

*While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

Empirical control requirements:
- Unfettered transparency
- Frequent inspections
- Immediate adaptations

*Working in **sprints** (smaller segments of the overall project) allows for this frequent inspection and adaptation.*

**Strengths of Agile Project Management**:
- Project success rate
- Scope creep
- Immediate adaptation based on frequent inspection
    - Progress
    - Customer satisfaction

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The unique contributions of many individuals can be very powerful.
Where a simple conversation can be clear and efficient, a lot of effort is needed to make
processes and managed/controlled communication unambiguous.
One process doesn't fit all teams and limits involvement of individuals.
Working without individual interactions is overall less Agile.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Supporting development:
- Requirements
- Product technical specifications

*This documentation should cover only 'just enough' information to be practical and efficient.*

Supporting management:
- Project schedule
- Weekly status reports
- Project communication plan

*While helping management, these do not add value to development.*

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

There should be an ongoing good and clear communication with the customer.

Traditionally:
- Start of project
- When scope changes
- End of project

Communication purely for negotiation discourages potentially valuable input from the customer.

You can't know less about a project than at the start,
so locking down project details at this point is hard due to a lack of information.

### Responding to change over following a plan

Frequently adapting to changing expectations will keep the project relevant and also avoids high costs
from making changes in a later stage of product maturity.


## Agile Principles

The 12 Agile principles:
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantages.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them an environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of success.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances Agility.
- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the work not done - is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

Additional 3 'platinum' principles:
- Resist formality
  - Reduce organizational hierarchy, by eliminating titles
  - Avoiding aesthetic investments like elaborate PowerPoint presentation and meeting minute forms
  - Educating stakeholders on the cost of such displays
- Think and act as a team
  - Develop in pairs and switch partners often
  - Uniform product development title
  - Report at the project team level only
  - Replace individual performance metrics with project team performance metrics
- Visualize rather than write
  - Stock on whiteboards, poster paper and drawing utilities
  - Using models instead of text to communicate concepts
  - Reporting project status through charts, graphs and dashboards
  
## Agile vs Historical Approaches

*In Agile development cost and schedules are fixed. It is the scope that is variable.*

### Agile Project Team
- Developers
- Testers
- Designers
- Project stakeholders
- Product owner
- Agile coach / Scrum master

The **product owner** is a project team member who is an expert on the product and the customer's business needs.
They prioritize product requirements and is available to provide daily clarifications and final acceptance to the development team.

The **Agile coach** acts as a buffer between the development team and distractions that slow down development effort.
They provide expertise on agile processes and facilitate consensus building and stakeholder communication.

### Sprints

Working in small **sprints** and completing functionality by priority ensures the project will add value for the customer.
While some features might not yet be implemented, the product will always have useful functionality even halfway the production process.
Historical approaches often require the project to be finished before adding any value to the customer and at this point 
making any changes would be harder and more expensive.

*Working in sprints provides areas of project stability, while also allowing for regular change.*

### Reducing Non-Productive Tasks

- In traditional projects **meetings** often take up a lot of time from developers, allowing for little time for development.
  Agile projects should require only little formal meetings. They are focussed, short and handle a specific topic.
  The Agile coach should try to prevent disruptions, which include non-agile meetings.
  The project status is usually visually available to the entire organization, removing the need for status meetings.

- Asking questions through **mail** is slow and inefficient. Face-to-face communication is faster and more concise.

- Preparing a *presentation* (with slides etc.) takes up a lot of time. A simple demonstration of the product fulfilling
  required functionality is both faster and more representable.

- Documentation is only useful when it adds value to the project. Our code and automated tests already document a lot of the
  development decisions that were made. Pictures & charts are usually more understandable than words, even for reporting to management.

### Improved Team Performance

- Environmental and organizational support for the team
  - Collocation of team with product owner, physically close to customer
  - Eliminating confusion
  - Removal of impediments
- Focus on the project
  - One project that gets all the focus
  - Availability of team members
  - Small independent units of functionality
  - No distractions = more productivity
- Continuous improvement
  - Each iteration is a fresh start
  - Quick incorporation of changes
  - A retrospective allows identifying and planning improvements
  - Entire team reviews aspects that need improvement
  - Lessons learned are taken to next sprint
- Tighter project control
  - Constant flow of information
  - Daily prioritization
  - Working functionality each sprint
  - No administrative cost to changes in 'next' sprint
  - Feature adequacy check at each sprint makes termination easy

*Agile development is not only faster, but allows for early detection of failure.
Providing opportunity to fix problems early and reduce the costs to do so.*
